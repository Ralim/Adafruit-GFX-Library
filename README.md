# Adafruit GFX without the Arduino

Trimmed some Arduino specific stuff, but otherwise left alone. For all of us who like this library for its simplicity; but dont like Arduino for various reasons.

Please support Adafruit, they do awesome work. I try to buy my screens from them whereever possible.
